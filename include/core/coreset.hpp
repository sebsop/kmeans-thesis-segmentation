// - `x, y`: the normalized spatial coordinates of the pixel in the frame ([0, 1] range).
// - `weight`: how many original pixels this point represents.

// A coreset is a small, weighted subset of points that approximates the original dataset.
// In this case, it compresses tens or hundreds of thousands of pixels into only a few thousand weighted points.
//
// Benefits:
// - Performance: running k-means on a coreset is much faster than on all pixels.
// - Accuracy: theory guarantees that clustering on a coreset gives results within (1±ε) of the full dataset,
//             and in practice it can even improve quality by reducing noise and redundancy.
// - Mergeability: coresets can be combined (merged) into new coresets while keeping size bounded.
